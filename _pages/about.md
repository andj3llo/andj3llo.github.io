Hello! My name is **Angelo Owusu** and I am a third-year student majoring in **Computer Engineering** focusing on **Control, Robotics, and Autonomy** at **Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University** in Blacksburg, VA. I want to be an engineer to improve technological systems. I am passionate about developing **embedded systems** that control robots and autonomous processes and hope to work in the field of manufacturing. I am also an active member of **Dart Design Team** and the **National Society of Black Engineers**.
